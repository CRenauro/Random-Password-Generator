# Random-Password-Generator

I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria,
so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

When I click "Generate Password", a dialog box appears. I then answer a series of prompts for password criteria.

When I answer each prompt, my input is validated.

When all prompts are answered, a password is generated that meets the selected criteria.

The password will appear in the central rectangle. Before and after are below.
